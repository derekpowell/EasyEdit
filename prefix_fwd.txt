a fruitbat rests by hanging upside-down
a shark's skeleton is cartilage
food for a hummingbird must be nectar
a rhinoceros has a thick hide
a worm lives underground
a hammerhead is a type of shark
a koala has two thumbs
a cougar is a type of mammal
some sheep make wool
a tamarin is a kind of monkey
a parrot can talk
a wolf belongs to a pack
